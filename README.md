# Flower Classification App
### This is a web application built using Streamlit and TensorFlow that classifies flower images into one of five categories: Daisy, Sunflower, Rose, Dandelion, or Tulip. The model predicts the flower type based on the image uploaded by the user.

### Features
Upload an image of a flower.
The app uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify the flower as one of the following:
Daisy
Sunflower
Rose
Dandelion
Tulip
The app displays the predicted flower type along with the confidence score.
If the model is not confident enough (below 50%), it will notify the user that the prediction was not found.
### Technologies Used
TensorFlow: For making model and making predictions.
Streamlit: For creating the user interface.
Pillow: For image processing.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
